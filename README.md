## Overview

Traditional personal finance tools often introduce friction through server-side latency or bloated interfaces. **Smart Budget Planner** provides an immediate, responsive ledger operating entirely in the browser. The platform separates self-serve personal finance tracking from platform-wide administrative monitoring while keeping user datasets fully isolated locally.

## Core Features

### 1. Dual-Module System
* **User Module**:
  * Log income and expense transactions across dedicated categories (Housing & Rent, Groceries & Food, Utilities, Entertainment, Transit, Salary, Investments, Freelance, Other).
  * View dynamic financial summaries: Total Income, Total Expenses, and Net Balance.
  * Track monthly savings targets with an adaptive percentage progress bar.
  * Reactive category expenditure breakdown visualized through Chart.js.
  * Itemized chronological transaction log with inline deletion support.
* **Admin Module**:
  * Global system analytics tracking Total Registered Users, System Total Transactions, and Aggregate Platform Cash Flow.
  * Central User Directory displaying account usernames, assigned roles, record volumes, and live net balances.
  * Account governance allowing deletion of test/inactive users and their associated records while securing the root administrator profile.

### 2. State Management & Data Privacy
* **Local Persistence**: State handling using browser `localStorage` for credentials (`bp_users`), active sessions (`bp_session`), and target goals (`bp_goal_<username>`).
* **User Data Scoping**: Transaction ledgers are sandboxed under `bp_records_<username>`, ensuring distinct user datasets remain completely private and isolated on the device.

### 3. Responsive Layout
* Built using modern **CSS Flexbox** for navigation alignment and **CSS Grid** (`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr))`) for fluid metric reflow on mobile and desktop viewports.
